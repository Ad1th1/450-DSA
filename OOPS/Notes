Constructors 
  -same name as class
  - no return type 
  - can be over-loaded, default constructor with no parameters is a must in this case

Destructor syntax: ~Constructor()

destructor is called when we delete the created object or if it goes out of scope

static - variable
  -only checked during first execution
  
private and protected functions are accessible only to member functions
to access outside member function use 'friend' function

by default, access specifier is private

> inheritance allows us to define the features described in one class in another class
