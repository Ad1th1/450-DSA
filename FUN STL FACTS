> INT_MIN and INT_MAX when you want to give your variable a super big or small value
> Syntax for priority queue:
      priority_queue <int, vector<int>, greater<int>> g = gq;     //stored as min-heap
> Memset
      used to fill a block with a particular value

> Unordered set
      unique keys in any order
 
-> Set -> Ordered and Unordered

Ordered Set
-> contains unique elements
-> implemented using balanced BST
-> elements are in sorted order
-> no randome access possible
-> #include<set> header
 
-> The lower_bound() method in C++ is used to return an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first, last) which has a value not less than val.
