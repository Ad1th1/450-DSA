-> Used to find minimum spanning tree
-> uses disjoint set data structure

-> sort edges according to weight
-> check if two nodes belong to the same component
      -> if they do, dont connect them ( we can't have cycles in an MST)
      -> if they don't, connect them
-> Time Complexity = O(Mlog(M)) -> sorting of edges
-> Space Complexity = O(M) -> parent, rank vector
