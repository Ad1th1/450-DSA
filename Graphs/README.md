Important Points to remember:

Dijkstra Algorithm: 
	> used to find shortest path in a graph
	> doesn't work for -ve weights
	
Components of a graph = disconnected portions of graph

Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.
