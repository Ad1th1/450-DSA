Important Points to remember:

Dijkstra Algorithm: 
	> used to find shortest path in a graph
	> doesn't work for -ve weights
	
Components of a graph = disconnected portions of graph

Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.

Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. 
A single graph can have many different spanning trees. 
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. 
The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

In graph theory, a component of an undirected graph is a connected subgraph that is not part of any larger connected subgraph.
