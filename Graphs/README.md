Important Points to remember:

BFS - queue implementation for iterative approach\
DFS - stack implementation for iterative approach

Dijkstra Algorithm: 
	> used to find shortest path in a graph\
	> doesn't work for -ve weights
	
Components of a graph = disconnected portions of graph

Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. \
~ like preparing a table

In graph theory, a component of an undirected graph is a connected subgraph that is not part of any larger connected subgraph.

Disjoint set - data structure with parent and rank array for Kruskal's algorithm

MST 
-> contains N nodes and N-1 edges\
-> every node is reachable -> spanning tree\
-> minimum cost of edge weight -> MST\
-> Prims and Kruskal algorithm

Connected Graph:\
-> visited array for multiple components
