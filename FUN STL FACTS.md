- INT_MIN and INT_MAX when you want to give your variable a super big or small value
- Syntax for priority queue:
      priority_queue <int, vector<int>, greater<int>> g = gq;     //stored as min-heap
- Memset
      used to fill a block with a particular value

- Unordered set
      unique keys in any order
 
- Set -> Ordered and Unordered

Ordered Set
- contains unique elements
- implemented using balanced BST
- elements are in sorted order
- no randome access possible
- #include<set> header
 
The lower_bound() method in C++ is used to return an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first, last) which has a value not less than val. 

Multiset
-> can contain duplicates
-> elements are in sorted order
-> insertion and deletion = O(logN)

Unordered Set
- contains unique elements
- not in sorted order
- no random access
- #include<unordered<set>
- insertion O(1)
- Deletion O(1)
- No lower or upper bound


Maps
-> stores key-value pairs
